Hello, my name is Ilham. I am going to give a brief guide to prepare a software engineering interview. It would be based on my experiences (which is not so many). I have interviewed in more than 10 companies in my lifetime, start from local startups in Indonesia - startups in Singapore and Europe - big companies like Google and Facebook. Moreover, I don't have a competitive programming background, so I hope the guide would be quiet general. You will find something better than my guide on the internet I guess, but at least I am trying to be useful. The guide is my references for my interviews.
### Applying - HR interview - Coding interview - System Design Interview
Yups, most of the time those are the interview steps that you need to prepare. Of course, it would be different for every company (e.g: GMAT, Personality Test), but the core in software engineering are Coding and System Design (and of course personality, I assume you won't mess up on this).
## Coding Interview
### Algorithm and Data Structure Questions
Make sure you practice a lot for the preparation, the best site for this is [https://leetcode.com/](https://leetcode.com/) and your interviewer may get their questions from it. However, you don't want to memorize all the solutions. I would suggest understanding the basic concept in Algorithm and Data Structure. For example, learn the concept of Binary Tree, after you understand it very well, go practice some questions about the topic. References:

* [https://leetcode.com/](https://leetcode.com/) prefer easy-medium. Rarely for Hard, but you might face it.

### Object Oriented Coding
It would the same advice as before, learn Algorithm and Data Structure and practice it in real scenarios simple cases. I would suggest this:

## System Design
I learn from these:
* [https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer), it's also a good reading material.
* [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCn1XnDWhsLS5URXTi5wtFTA](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCn1XnDWhsLS5URXTi5wtFTA), it might not show the step-by-step to scale apps, but it is good for reviewing existing design in popular apps.

## Applying
This is the gate for your interview process. There are many ways to start an interview, LinkedIn and career pages are the most common for me.
## Resume
My resume is pretty simple actually. In general, my resume design is based on this example: [https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/writing-a-killer-software-engineering-resume-b11c91ef699d/](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/writing-a-killer-software-engineering-resume-b11c91ef699d/)
